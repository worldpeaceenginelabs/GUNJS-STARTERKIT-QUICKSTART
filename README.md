### Need a hand? Artificial Intelligence Pair Programming
##### I work with ChatGPT for hours every day.
##### He writes me prototypes and POCs, and i just modify them myself.
##### It makes everything soo much easier. It's perfect for checking ideas right away. [See for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng438SIXyW4&t=100s)

##### GunJS can be explained as a decentralized alternative to cloud-based services like Dropbox and Firebase. Both Dropbox and Firebase provide cloud-based storage and synchronization of data, but with GunJS, the data is stored and synchronized across a decentralized network of peers, rather than relying on a central server. In this setup, each user's device acts as a node in the network, storing a copy of the data and making it available to other nodes. This means that data is always accessible, even if one node goes offline, because it can be retrieved from another node. GunJS also provides real-time synchronization, ensuring that all nodes in the network have the latest version of the data, similar to Dropbox and Firebase, but with the added benefits of improved security and privacy, as data is not controlled by a central authority. Additionally, GunJS allows for peer-to-peer data sharing, enabling users to directly exchange data without having to go through a central server. This makes it a flexible and scalable solution for real-time data storage and synchronization, similar to Firebase, but with a decentralized approach.<br>

## Storage logic

### GunJS - Included and third-party storage solutions https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki/Storage
#### To permanently store all GUN's data, your GUN server app must define which storage engine to use. By default a GUN server will store the data in a file, but this is just meant to be used during development. It is not a sound solution for production.
#### However, GUN is different to most other databases when it comes to dev vs prod setup in that the only distinction is that a production setup can maybe include a persistent storage option (e.g. AWS S3, IPFS...) for a participating relay peer. That's not mandatory though, browsers peers with their localStorage storage are sufficient more often than not, doesn't matter if you're still in development or already running your app in production with customers.<br>
<br>

# QUICKSTART for components, apps, webapps, dapps... (the decentralized back-end)
<br>

## GUN Relays (Gun works local first even without a relay, but for syncing between clients you need a relay)
### [Gun Relay (How to run a node - Deploy a GUN relay server everywhere on GUN WIKI)](https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki#how-to-run-a-node---deploy-a-gun-relay-server-everywhere)
### [Gun Relay Desktop (Electron Gun)](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/ELECTRON-GUN)
### [Gun Relay Donation Tool (Donate Decentralize UI)](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/DONATE-DECENTRALIZE-UI)<br>
<br>

## .get() | .put | .on - There are [more methods...](https://gun.eco/docs/API) but these three are the basic ones.
### This is pretty much the core of everything. Notice how easy it is to connect your front-end code with the graph database GUN.
### Notice that no matter how complex your function is: You just drop the result into one or multible variables and connect them to the GUN write function (green boxes, green lines).
### Last, you can easily receive the data in any function, again, no matter how complex, by ```db.on(data => {//your function here});``` and get the data that you wrote to GUN before (red boxes, red lines)<br>
<br>

### This script saves a long/lat pair to the GUN graph, and renders a point on the globe, if the local clients graph (browser local storage) or a connected graph (GUN-Relay) receive a new entry.<br>
### The ```.on(graphname)``` subscribes to the GUN graph. Everything's new to the graph will automatically be rendered on the globe. Both local storage graph and/or relay graph changes!
<br>

# Spaces

##### GUN supports more than just key/value pairs, it is a graph database that can store SQL-like tables, JSON-like documents, files and livestreaming video, plus relational and hypergraph data!
##### Beware! Anyone can edit the data by default - to fix this, we have to use the User system. GUN is a universal graph which has 3 logical "spaces" protected by SEA:
<br>

## Public Space - ```.get(graphname).put(data)``` https://gun.eco/docs/API
### Anyone can add, change, or remove data from here. Think of it as a giant wiki.
##### Note: Some data here may be encrypted such that the content stays secret, but it can always be overwritten. Imagine in real life someone hides a prize in a vault at the beach: Once it is found it may be damaged or moved, but only a person who knows the key can unlock it.
<br>

## User Space - ```user.get(graphname).put(data)``` https://gun.eco/docs/User
### (or Key Space) Only data signed with the user's key can be put. Uses SEA. This data can only be be changed, added or removed, by the owner. The data can be either private or publicly readable.
##### Note: Data is cryptographically owned by the user, there is no "app admin" or "website owner", this may change how you build apps but it guarantees better safety. Owners can authorize or give other users permission to edit the owner's data. Again, the owner does this, not the app developer or database admin.
<br>

## Frozen Space - ```var data = "hello world"; var hash = await SEA.work(data, null, null, {name: "SHA-256"}); gun.get('#').get(hash).put(data);``` https://gun.eco/docs/Frozen
### (Hash Space, Content Id Space) The # operator is used. Gun interprets something like "Only allow data to be put here if its hash matches the appended hash object." This data cannot be changed or removed, only added to. Nobody owns this data.
##### Note: If nobody stores the data it may be forgotten, if the peers that store it are offline the data may not be found until they are online again. This is true of data in any space though.

<br><br>

# SEA - Security, Encryption, & Authorization
### https://gun.eco/docs/SEA
<br>

## Sign-up, login, authentication, session management, and log-out
### When a user signs up, the signup function creates a new user account with the given username and password. When a user logs in, the login function authenticates the user with the given username and password. When a user is authenticated, they are able to access their session data through the user object. The logout function logs the user out of their session.

<br><br>

## Store data encrypted to User Space
### This code encrypts the text 'secret text' with the user's public key using the Gun.SEA.encrypt method. The encrypted text is then stored in the user's private space using the db.user().get('encryptedText').put(encryptedText) method. NOTE: We need an authenticated (logged-in) user for this code to work.
